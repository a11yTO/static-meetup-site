<!-- <h1>Meetups</h1>
<p>To provide our community with the most accessible experience possible, <strong>#a11yTO</strong> is not currently using the Meetup platform.</p>
<p>To stay up to date with our events and programming, <a href="https://a11yto.com" rel="external">please visit a11yto.com</a> or <a href="https://a11y.to/signup" rel="external">subscribe to our newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. <strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community through our Meetups, and accessibility in general. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p> -->

<h2>The Event</h2>
<p>Once a product team is consistently meeting fundamentals of web accessibility, what comes next?
<p>Let’s explore this topic with David, as he shares insights from his 22 months on the GOV.UK Design System, crafting a strategy to advance one of the world’s most accessible government design systems.</p>
<p>The process, challenges and results? Join us on January the 30th from 6pm to 8pm at Microsoft to find out. But here’s a hint: a well-placed accessibility strategy can multiply a product team’s positive impact, hopefully improving the lives of many.</p>
