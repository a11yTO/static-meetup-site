<!-- <h1>Meetups</h1>
<p>To provide our community with the most accessible experience possible, <strong>#a11yTO</strong> is not currently using the Meetup platform.</p>
<p>To stay up to date with our events and programming, <a href="https://a11yto.com" rel="external">please visit a11yto.com</a> or <a href="https://a11y.to/signup" rel="external">subscribe to our newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. <strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community through our Meetups, and accessibility in general. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p> -->

<h2>The Event</h2>
<p>We’re excited to announce a special social event for this month! As we gear up for the <a href="https://conf.a11yto.com/">upcoming <strong>#a11yTO</strong> conference</a>, we’re taking a short break from our regular meetups. But we didn’t want to miss the chance to connect with all of you!</p>
<p>Join us on Thursday, September 19th, starting at 6 PM at Firkin on Yonge (207 Yonge St, Toronto, Ontario M5B 2H1) for a casual social gathering. This is a great opportunity to catch up with friends, meet new people, and enjoy some good conversation in a relaxed setting.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: The lounge is booked that day for another event, but a11yTO has reserved the back half of the upstairs. We’ll have our own space to connect and enjoy the evening together.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a regular attendee or new to our community, we’d love to see you there! Let’s come together, share our experiences, and keep the momentum going as we look forward to <strong>#a11yTO Conf</strong>.</p>
<p>We hope you can make it!</p>
