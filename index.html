<h2>The Event</h2>
<p>
  Data plays a crucial role in storytelling, decision-making, and communication.
  But how do we ensure that data visualizations are accessible to everyone,
  including people with disabilities?
</p>
<p>
  Join us on March 5th for a session exploring the intersection of inclusive
  design principles and data visualization. This talk will provide actionable
  insights into creating clear, effective, and accessible visual representations
  of data that go beyond aesthetics and prioritize usability for all audiences.

  Our speaker, Sindhu Gadepalli, is a Product Designer with expertise in product
  discovery and research. With a focus on diverse and inclusive user
  experiences, she has helped shape products that are both visually compelling

  Founding Designer with a startup.
