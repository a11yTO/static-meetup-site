<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. <strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community through our Meetups, and accessibility in general. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p> -->

<h2>The Event</h2>
<p>One in ten Canadians faces some degree of hearing loss. Poor media representation of accessibility is a reality.</p>
<p>Wendy Tabor will discuss challenges to Deaf Canadians, including unemployment, by showcasing advocacy and presenting legal cases, such as Marlee Matlin's lawsuit against Netflix. This talk will shed light on successful legal actions and the importance of creating inclusive workplaces, drawing on Statistics Canada's findings on inclusive workplaces.</p>
<p>Wendy is a dedicated and Certified Registered Graphic Designer with expertise in navigating complex regulatory frameworks without compromising innovative design solutions. As a Hard-Of-Hearing individual, she brings a unique perspective to her work, championing inclusivity in every design endeavour.</p>
