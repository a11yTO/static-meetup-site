<h1>Meetups</h1>
<p>To provide our community with the most accessible experience possible, <strong>#a11yTO</strong> is not currently using the Meetup platform.</p>
<p>To stay up to date with our events and programming, <a href="https://a11yto.com" rel="external">please visit a11yto.com</a> or <a href="https://a11y.to/signup" rel="external">subscribe to our newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. <strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community through our Meetups, and accessibility in general. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p>

<!-- <h2>The Event</h2>

<p>Implementing Accessibility in the early stages of planning improves the process and results. The process should include a framework/checklist for designers, developers, and testers to improve their digital product deliverables.</p>
<p>Join us on July 28 at the brand new Microsoft Office for our first 2022 in-person meetup. Shraddha Chauhan will walk through the value of integrating accessibility with the preliminary stages of the project planning.</p>
