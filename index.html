<!-- <h1>Meetups</h1>
<p>To provide our community with the most accessible experience possible, <strong>#a11yTO</strong> is not currently using the Meetup platform.</p>
<p>To stay up to date with our events and programming, <a href="https://a11yto.com" rel="external">please visit a11yto.com</a> or <a href="https://a11y.to/signup" rel="external">subscribe to our newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. <strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community through our Meetups, and accessibility in general. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p> -->

<h2>The Event</h2>
<p>To mark Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD), we’re doing things a little differently this month. No panel. No slides. Just time together.</p>
<p>Join us for a relaxed, in-person social at the Firkin on Yonge. This is a chance to reconnect with the community, meet new folks, share a few stories, and have some meaningful conversations.</p>
<p>As part of the evening, we’re inviting anyone who’s interested to take part in mini lightning prompts. These are three-minute, opt-in moments to share something from your own accessibility journey — a small win, a helpful tool, a learning moment, or something you’re thinking about. Whether you’re new to the space or a longtime practitioner, everyone has something valuable to contribute.</p>
<p>The goal is to keep things casual and welcoming. No need to prep slides or have a big polished story. Just come as you are and be part of the conversation.</p>
<h3 class="sub-head">Important:</h3>
<p>The lounge is booked that night for another event, but a11yTO has reserved the back half of the upstairs.</p>
<p>This is a social event — not a formal talk — and there will be no livestream or recording.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p>
