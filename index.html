<h2>The Event</h2>
<p>In our digital era, banking plays a pivotal role in driving innovation in digital accessibility. Join us on November 20th for an insightful discussion led by industry experts on the importance of incorporating accessibility practices into product development. This talk will explore how research can establish a foundation for usability and accessibility in digital products.</p>
<p>Our presenters, Anna Tendera, Ph.D. (Senior Quantitative Researcher, BMO Digital), and Josiah Gifford (Senior Manager, BMO Digital), will share their experiences and discuss critical goals among accessibility priorities, including how these align with organizational maturity models. We will also delve into the ethical obligations of financial institutions to prioritize accessibility in their digital platforms and services.</p>
<p>This meetup aims to catalyze meaningful discussions and foster collaborations to build a more inclusive and innovative banking ecosystem. By recognizing accessibility as both a moral imperative and a driver of innovation, we can work toward empowering individuals of all abilities to participate fully in the digital economy.</p>
<p>We hope you can make it!</p>
