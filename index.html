<!-- <h1>Meetups</h1>
<p>To provide our community with the most accessible experience possible, <strong>#a11yTO</strong> is not currently using the Meetup platform.</p>
<p>To stay up to date with our events and programming, <a href="https://a11yto.com" rel="external">please visit a11yto.com</a> or <a href="https://a11y.to/signup" rel="external">subscribe to our newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. <strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community through our Meetups, and accessibility in general. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p> -->

<h2>The Event Canceled Due to Weather</h2>

<p>
  Due to the severe winter storm expected in Toronto today, we have made the
  difficult decision to
  <strong>cancel tonightâ€™s a11yTO meetup (February 12, 2025)</strong>. With up
  to 20 cm of snow in the forecast, we want to prioritize the safety of all
  attendees.
</p>

<p>
  We will do our best to
  <strong>reschedule this talk for a future date</strong> and will share updates
  as soon as we have more details.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to seeing you at a
  future a11yTO meetup.
</p>

<p>Stay safe,</p>

<p>The <strong>#a11yTO Team</strong></p>
