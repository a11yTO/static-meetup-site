<h2>The Event</h2>

<p>Happy April, everyone. In March, we hosted our first online meetup. We were delighted for your attendance and participation in a virtual space. Please join us for our second of many virtual meetups.</p>
<p>On April 21, Ashley Bischoff will be there with you to discuss Plain Language.</p>
<p>Writing reports and documentation is nothing new. We can do our best to write clearly, but our content might not be familiar to our readers. Our words won’t do any good if our readers can’t understand what we’re trying to say.</p>
<p>Get some straightforward tips on techniques to help ensure that our message is clear. We will moderate conversations through the zoom chat and Q&A feature.</p>
<p>Ashley Bischoff is an accessibility wonk and copy editor for The Paciello Group. She has a knack for taming technical and business writing. Ashley is a heartfelt advocate for plain language and relishes any chance to comb corporate-speak into everyday language.</p>
<p>Ashley lives in Dallas, and she likes listening to metal and drinking tea.</p>
