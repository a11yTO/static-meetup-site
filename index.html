<h2>The Events</h2>

<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. We try to meet once a month for presentations, tech talks, demos and more.</p>
<p><strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community and our Meetups. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p>
<p>If you're interested in accessibility and inclusive design, this is your home.</p>
