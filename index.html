<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. <strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community through our Meetups, and accessibility in general. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p> -->

<h2>The Event</h2>
<p>Join us on Wednesday, July 12, at the Microsoft Offices in CIBC Square, where Dan Tripp will share his experiences overcoming this challenge using the all-pairs testing technique and Microsoft's "PICT" (Pairwise Independent Combinatorial Tool).</p>
<p><strong>What is All-pairs testing</strong>? â€” <em>We're glad you asked</em>.</p>
<p>All-pairs testing is a method that tests all possible discrete combinations of those parameters for each pair of input parameters to a system.</p>
<p>We often want to test with different browser combinations, viewport sizes, and CSS layouts. Testing every combination is overwhelming and unmanageable.</p>
<p>Dan Tripp is a Digital Accessibility Engineer with Siteimprove, dedicated to all things accessibility.</p>
