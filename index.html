<h1>Meetups</h1>

<p>Our meetups will return soon. Meetups will likely continue to be virtual for the time being, but we are exploring opportunities to run hybrid or in-person events once it’s warmer outside.</p>
<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. <strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community through our Meetups, and accessibility in general. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p>
<p>If you're interested in accessibility and inclusive design, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/a11yTO/">join us</a>. We try to meet once a month for presentations, tech talks, demos and more. We post updates on our Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/a11yTO">@a11yTO</a>, be sure to follow us there for the latest news.</p>

<!-- <h2>The Event</h2>
<p>Writing reports and documentation is nothing new. We can do our best to write clearly, but our content might not be familiar to our readers. Our words won’t do any good if our readers can’t understand what we’re trying to say.</p>
<p>Join us on July 14th to get some straightforward tips on techniques to help ensure that our message is clear.</p>
