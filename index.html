<!-- <h1>Meetups</h1>
<p>To provide our community with the most accessible experience possible, <strong>#a11yTO</strong> is not currently using the Meetup platform.</p>
<p>To stay up to date with our events and programming, <a href="https://a11yto.com" rel="external">please visit a11yto.com</a> or <a href="https://a11y.to/signup" rel="external">subscribe to our newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. <strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community through our Meetups, and accessibility in general. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p> -->

<h2>The Event</h2>
<p>Design tokens are all the rage. They exist to power consistent experiences efficiently. It truly is a powerful thing to deliver platform-agnostic consistent experiences or quickly update a style that propagates via inheritance, even across nested design systems. The resultant consistency and efficiency are the main drivers for their recent popularity.</p>
<p>Design tokens work at the base property level, where the tiniest design decisions are made, for instance, colour, padding, or font weight. How these micro-decisions work together or instead donâ€™t work well together can influence whether the experience is accessible.</p>
<p>Karen Hawkins will show you how design tokens can significantly influence the accessibility of your designs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Karen will show you how design token decisions affect the accessibility of UI elements.</li>
  <li>You will learn how to use design tokens to improve the accessibility of UI elements.</li>
  <li>And, you will leave this meetup understanding the importance of using design tokens to ensure a consistent experience across a broad set of UI elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The meetup starts at 6:00 on November 9, 2023, in the Microsoft office at CIBC Square. Registration and a QR code is required to access the event.</p>
