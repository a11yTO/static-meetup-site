<h1>Meetups</h1>

<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. <strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community through our Meetups, and accessibility in general. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p>
<p>If you're interested in accessibility and inclusive design, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/a11yTO/">join us</a>. We try to meet once a month for presentations, tech talks, demos and more. We post updates on our Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/a11yTO">@a11yTO</a>, be sure to follow us there for the latest news.</p>

<!-- <h2>The Event</h2>

<p>Implementing Accessibility in the early stages of planning improves the process and results. The process should include a framework/checklist for designers, developers, and testers to improve their digital product deliverables.</p>
<p>Join us on July 28 at the brand new Microsoft Office for our first 2022 in-person meetup. Shraddha Chauhan will walk through the value of integrating accessibility with the preliminary stages of the project planning.</p>
