<p>The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a fantastic hub for digital accessibility and inclusive design. <strong>#a11yTO</strong> welcomes everyone to our community through our Meetups, and accessibility in general. Our goal is to provide a place for you to learn, share your experiences, ideas, and solutions and collaborate on building a more inclusive web.</p> -->

<h2>The Event</h2>
<p><strong>#a11yTO</strong> is partnering with the Google Developer's Group (GDG) Toronto for our August Meetup.
<p>GDG Toronto is a community group gathering self-motivated, collaborative, and genuine individuals interested in exploring the possibilities of technologies. GDG organizes study jams, conferences, Google conference extended, speaker sessions, and hackathons. Join us in Downtown Toronto at the League Office as Vaibhav Saraf presents solutions for some of these code-level barriers using popular programming languages for native mobile.</p>
<p>In the mobile-first era, interactions with mobile apps have increased. However, many apps are not usable for everyone as they have common accessibility problems, like missing unlabelled images and controls, semantics, or small touch targets and font sizes.</p>
