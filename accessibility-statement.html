<h2>Our Commitment</h2>
<p>We take accessibility seriously at <strong>#a11yTO</strong> and strive to create opportunities to learn, share and have fun in a space designed to be used and enjoyed by everyone. This means all our attendees, presenters, volunteers, and the <a href="https://a11yto.com/organizers">organizers</a>, across all of our events whether in person or online.</p>
<p>Here is what we are doing currently to achieve that.</p>
<h3>What we’re doing</h3>
<h4 class="sub-head">Meetups, Camps and Conferences</h4>
<p>We work with community partners and sponsors to host events in spaces and on platforms where a good level of accessibility is possible. By that we mean:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Level entrance from outside, with power door operators;</li>
  <li>An elevator if the event is not on the entrance level;</li>
  <li>Multi-stall washrooms with barrier-free stall, or universal washroom;</li>
  <li>A meeting space with a variety of lines of sight, choice of seating, and space to move around;</li>
  <li>Good lighting and low glare, background noise, and echoes;</li>
  <li>Real time captioning (CART) at all events;</li>
  <li>Sign-language (ASL) interpretation for all conference talks and announcements (IRL, Conf, and Gaming);</li>
  <li>Sign-language (ASL) interpretation at Camp keynotes and primary track (meaning, not all tracks by default);</li>
  <li>Public address systems (where the space allows);</li>
  <li>A ramp to the conference stage (when a stage is used);</li>
  <li>A height-adjustable work surface/lectern at conferences;</li>
  <li>Clear, large-print, directional signage;</li>
  <li>Volunteers positioned throughout to provide support;</li>
  <li>At all online events, live captions will be provided. And should you require other accommodations when it comes to online events, <a href="mailto:info@a11yTO.com">do not hesitate to let us know</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes an elevator or washroom may be hard to find, or power door operators aren’t installed on interior routes – we anticipate this and will post a volunteer in these places.</p>
<h4 class="sub-head">Other Events</h4>
<p>Our social events outside of meetups, camps, and conferences often happen in pubs which meet the entrance, washroom, and elevator descriptions above. They are often loud, and lighting is inconsistent.</p>
<p>If you have a recommendation for a central, barrier-free venue at a reasonable price point, where not everyone has to buy something, and which can handle fluctuating reservations of 30-90 people, please let someone on the organizing committee know.</p>
<h4 class="sub-head">Presentations</h4>
<p>Our events bring together speakers with various levels of presenting experience but we expect these basics:
<ul>
  <li>Speak slowly and clearly, using the microphone, while facing the audience;</li>
  <li>Show slides which are clear with text sized appropriately for the size of the room;</li>
  <li>Describe diagrams, memes, charts or anything that is not decorative.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are presenting and are speaking too quickly for the sign-language interpreter or captioner, you will be asked to slow down.</p>
<p>If you are asking a question you will be asked to use the microphone. You can also give your question to someone else to ask into the microphone. Where audience microphones are not available, the speaker will be asked to repeat the question for everyone.</p>
<p>We don’t live-stream events or share presenters’ slide decks directly; we cannot ensure that they are accessible.</p>
<h4 class="sub-head">Communications</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you need a conference schedule in Braille, please let us know in advance;</li>
  <li>We have some large-print schedules and conference packages available at camps and conferences.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="sub-head">Other Considerations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Please be considerate of other attendees and follow scent-free practices;</li>
  <li>Service dogs are very welcome. Please ask a volunteer if you need assistance locating a green space during breaks;</li>
  <li>Conference (IRL, Conf, and Gaming) attendees will be asked if they have dietary restrictions;</li>
  <li>Camp attendees will be offered meals that include gluten-free and vegan options;</li>
  <li>Meetups tend to have pizza, pop, and beer, with water also available. We do our best to provide gluten free and vegan pizzas;</li>
  <li>If you are attending a paid event and need to bring an attendant, let us know at <a href="mailto:info@a11yTO.com">info@a11yTO.com</a> and we can register them at no charge;</li>
  <li>Part of our commitment to accessibility is that <a href="/code-of-conduct">we have and enforce a Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
</ul>
