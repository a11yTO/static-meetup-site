        <h1>Code of <br />Conduct</h1>
        <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our events, including Meetups, camp, and conferences, are required to abide by the following code of conduct.</p>
        <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other offensive material. </p>
        <p>Organizers will enforce this code and expect cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
        <p>Our organization is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion or technology choices.</p>
        <p>We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>
        <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, disability, age, sexual orientation, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
        <p>If anyone engages in harassing behaviour, the #a11yTO may take any action deemed appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.</p>
        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the #a11yTO staff immediately. #a11yTO staff will be introduced at smaller events and can be identified at larger events as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your cooperation. We hope that you can help us to maintain a safe and harassment free environment at our events.</p>
